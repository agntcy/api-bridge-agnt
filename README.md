# API Bridge Agnt

## About The Project

The API Bridge Agnt project provides a [Tyk](https://tyk.io/) middleware plugin that allows users to interact with traditional REST APIs
using natural language. It acts as a translator between human language and structured API requests/responses.

Key features:
- Converts natural language queries into valid API requests based on OpenAPI specifications
- Transforms API responses back into natural language explanations
- Integrates with Tyk API Gateway as a plugin
- Uses Azure OpenAI's GPT models for language processing
- Preserves API schema validation and security while enabling conversational interfaces

This enables developers to build more accessible and user-friendly API interfaces without modifying
the underlying API implementations.
