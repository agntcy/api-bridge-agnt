# API Bridge Agnt

## About The Project

The API Bridge Agnt project provides a [Tyk](https://tyk.io/) middleware plugin
that allows users to interact with traditional REST APIs using natural language.
It acts as a translator between human language and structured API
requests/responses.

Key features:
- Converts natural language queries into valid API requests based on OpenAPI specifications
- Transforms API responses back into natural language explanations
- Integrates with Tyk API Gateway as a plugin
- Uses Azure OpenAI's GPT models for language processing
- Preserves API schema validation and security while enabling conversational interfaces

This enables developers to build more accessible and user-friendly API interfaces without modifying
the underlying API implementations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go
- Cmake
- Git
- jq

Tyk required also a redis database. You can deploy it with:
```bash
make start_redis
```

### Local development

Built with:
- [search](https://github.com/kelindar/search) for the semantic router
- [Tyk](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk.git) for the gateway
We use these dependencies inside the project. However, you don't need to download it or to build it, 
everything is managed by the Makefile.

#### Step 1 - Set environment variables

For OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

For Azure OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY
export OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT.openai.azure.com
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

#### Step 2 - Build the plugin and start tyk locally on [Tyk](http://localhost:8080)

Dependencies are managed so that you can just run: 
```bash
make start_tyk 
```
This will automatically build "Tyk", "search" and the plugin, then install the plugin and start Tyk gateway

#### Step 3 - Load and configure Tyk with an example API (httpbin.org)

```bash
make load_plugin
```

### Other installation

#### Linux

for linux (ubuntu) you can use:
```bash
TARGET_OS=linux TARGET_ARCH=amd64 SEARCH_LIB=libllama_go.so make start_tyk
```

#### Individual steps for building if needed:

If you need to decompose each task individually, you can split into  
```bash
make build_tyk          # build tyk
make build_search_lib   # build the "search" library, used as semantic router
make build_plugin       # build the plugin
make install_plugin     # Install the plugin
```

## Tyk configuration

This plugins relies on [Tyk OAS API Definition](https://tyk.io/docs/api-management/gateway-config-tyk-oas/).
To use it, you need to add the plugin to the `postPlugins` and `responsePlugins`
sections of the `x-tyk-api-gateway` section:

```json
"x-tyk-api-gateway": {
[...]
  "middleware": {
    "global": {
      "pluginConfig": {
        "data": {
          "enabled": true,
          "value": {
          }
        },
        "driver": "goplugin"
      },
      "postPlugins": [
        {
          "enabled": true,
          "functionName": "SelectAndRewrite",
          "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
        },
        {
          "enabled": true,
          "functionName": "RewriteQueryToOas",
          "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
        }
      ],
      "responsePlugins": [
        {
          "enabled": true,
          "functionName": "RewriteResponseToNl",
          "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
        }
      ]
[...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Select and rewrite middleware

The first middleware function (`SelectAndRewrite`) is responsible for selecting
the appropriate OpenAPI endpoint based on the request, and then rewriting the
request to match the expected API format.

The content type for this request should be `application/nlq`.

Example:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/github/' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/nlq' \
  -d 'List the first issue for the repository named tyk owned by TykTechnologies with the label bug'
```

### Rewrite query

The second middleware function (`RewriteQueryToOas`) is only responsible for
converting the natural language query into a valid API request based on the
selected OpenAPI endpoint.

!> Here you MUST provide the full path of the target API in the request URL.
!> Rewriting the query will be available only if the content type is not set or is text/plain

Two headers are available for this request:

- **X-Nl-Query-Enabled**: `yes` or `no` (default is `no`), to enable or disable the natural language query processing
- **X-Nl-Response-Type**: `nl` or `upstream` (default is `upstream`), to select the response format. `nl` will return the response in natural language, while `upstream` will return the original API response.

Example:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/gmail/gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GOOGLE_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  --header 'X-Nl-Query-Enabled: yes' \
  --header 'X-Nl-Response-Type: nl' \
  --data 'Send an email to "john.doe@example.com". Explain that we are accepting is offer for Agntcy'
```

### Rewrite response

The third middleware function (`RewriteResponseToNl`) is responsible for
converting the API response into natural language.
It can be used standalone or in combination with the `RewriteQueryToOas` middleware.

### How to add an API to Tyk

1. Add OAS spec:

Adding a spec named "httpbin.org.oas.json" located in ./configs folder
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/tyk/apis/oas \
  --header "x-tyk-authorization: foo" \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d@configs/httpbin.org.oas.json

curl http://localhost:8080/tyk/reload/group \
  --header "x-tyk-authorization: foo"
```

2. Test request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/httpbin/json \
  --header "X-Nl-Query-Enabled: yes" \
  --header "X-Nl-Response-Type: nl" \
  --header "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hello"
```

### Github example

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/github/' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/nlq' \
  -d 'List the first issue for the repository named tyk owned by TykTechnologies with the label bug'
```

## Usage

As a usage exemple, we will use the API Bridge Agnt to send email via SENGRID API.

### Prequisites

- Get an API Key for free from sendgrid [sengrid by twilio](https://sendgrid.com/en-us)
- Retreive the open api spec here [tsg_mail_v3.json](https://github.com/twilio/sendgrid-oai/blob/main/spec/json/tsg_mail_v3.json)
- Start the plugin as described on "Getting Started" section

### Step 1 - Update the API with tyk middleware settings

You need to add on the API the parameters allowing the plugin to use it.

```json
{
  [...]
  "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
    "info": {
      "id": "tyk-sendgrid-id",
      "name": "Sendgrid Mail API",
      "state": {
        "active": true
      }
    },
    "upstream": {
      "url": "https://api.sendgrid.com"
    },
    "server": {
      "listenPath": {
        "value": "/sendgrid/",
        "strip": true
      }
    },
    "middleware": {
      "global": {
        "pluginConfig": {
          "data": {
            "enabled": true,
            "value": {
            }
          },
          "driver": "goplugin"
        },
        "postPlugins": [
          {
            "enabled": true,
            "functionName": "SelectAndRewrite",
            "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
          },
          {
            "enabled": true,
            "functionName": "RewriteQueryToOas",
            "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
          }
        ],
        "responsePlugins": [
          {
            "enabled": true,
            "functionName": "RewriteResponseToNl",
            "path": "middleware/agent-bridge-plugin.so"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  [...]
```

You have an example of a such configuration here ```./configs/api.sendgrid.com.oas.json```

### Step 2 - Configure an endpoint to allow plugin to retrieve it

On the same oas file, add a "x-nl-input-examples" element to an endpoint with 
sentence that describe how you can use the endpoint with natural language.
For example:

```json
{
  [...]
  "paths": {
    [...]
    "/v3/mail/send": {
      [...]
      "post": {
        [...]
        "x-nl-input-examples": [
          "Send an message to 'test@example.com' including a joke. Please use emojis inside it.",
          "Send an email to 'test@example.com' including a joke. Please use emojis inside it.",
          "Tell to 'test@example.com' that his new car is available.",
          "Write a profesional email to reject the candidate 'John Doe <test@example.com'"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  [...]
```

You have an example of a such configuration here ```./configs/api.sendgrid.com.oas.json```

### Step 3 - Add the API to tyk configuration

Your OAS API is ready to be integrated on the Tyk plugin:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/tyk/apis/oas \
  --header "x-tyk-authorization: foo" \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d@configs/api.sendgrid.com.oas.json

curl http://localhost:8080/tyk/reload/group \
  --header "x-tyk-authorization: foo"
```

### Step 4 - Test it !

Replace "agntcy@example.com" with a sender email you have configured on your sendgrid account.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/sendgrid/v3/mail/send \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/nlq' \
  -d 'Send a message from me (agntcy@example.com) to John Die <j.doe@example.com>. John is french, the message should be a joke using a lot of emojis, something fun about comparing France and Italy'
```

As a result, the receiver must receive a mail like:
```

Subject: A Little Joke for You! üá´üá∑üáÆüáπ

Hey John! üòÑ

I hope you're having a fantastic day! I just wanted to share a little joke with you:

Why did the French chef break up with the Italian chef? üçΩÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Because he couldn't handle all the pasta-bilities! üçùüòÇ

But don't worry, they still have a "bready" good friendship! ü•ñüòú

Just remember, whether it's croissants or cannoli, we can all agree that food brings us together! üç∑üç∞

Take care and keep smiling! üòä

Best,
agntcy

```
